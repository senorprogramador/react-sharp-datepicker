# react-sharp-datepicker
Tiny datepicker for React(-js), currently uses moment to format dates. Will be removed when ready.
No nonsense datepicker to keep development up-to-speed.

With this datepicker you can:
1. let a user type a date manually (with validation)
2. let a user select one from the popover
3. let a user pick a date-range
4. disable certain dates
5. disable all dates before a certain date
6. disable all dates after a certain date
7. clear a selected date

# Prerequisites:
1. React, Babel
2. Moment (TODO: remove)

# Installation:
```
npm i -S react-sharp-datepicker
```

# Usage:
See App.jsx for a preview of all functions in the datepicker.
